# Analysis Notebooks

The following notebooks step through analysis of the Treasure Hunt (TH) data.

## Treasure Hunt Analyses

The first set of notebooks demonstrate the analyses that are done on the Treasure Hunt task.

### 00-DataChecks

This notebook loads an example data file and does some basic data checks.

### 01-StimulusFiring

This notebook examines stimulus related neural activity, including:
- Cell firing to chest opening (during encoding) when objects / faces are presented

### 02-PlaceCells

This notebook examines place-related neural activity, including:
- Place cell analysis of the encoding-navigation phase

### 03-SpatialTargetCells

This notebook examines spatial-target related neural activity, including:
- Spatial target location activity: cell activity that relates to spatial target

### 04-SerialPositionCells

This notebook examines firing related to sequences in the task, including:
- Serial position activity: cell firing to the order of the chests within a trial

## Treasure Hunt Reports

This section creates systematic reports across subjects, sessions, and units.

Note that these notebooks demonsrate the reports, reports are generated by scripts.

### A1-Report-Group

This notebook demonstrates the report that is created at the group level.

### A2-Report-Session

This notebook demonstrates the report that is created at the session level.

### A3-Report-Unit

This notebook demonstrates the report that is created at the unit level.

# Analysis Notebooks

The following notebooks step through analysis of the TH data.

### 00-DataChecks

This notebook loads an example data file and does some basic data checks.

### 01-StimulusFiring

This notebook examines stimulus related neural activity, including:
- Cell firing to chest opening (during encoding) when objects / faces are presented

### 02-PlaceCells

This notebook examines place-related neural activity, including:
- Place cell analysis of the encoding-navigation phase

### 03-SpatialTargetCells

This notebook examines spatial-target related neural activity, including:
- Spatial target location activity: cell activity that relates to spatial target

### 04-SerialPositionCells

This notebook examines firing related to sequences in the task, including:
- Serial position activity: cell firing to the order of the chests within a trial
